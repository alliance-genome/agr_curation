In one transgene the cDNA encodes a chimeric amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein (APPswe). In the second transgene the cDNA encodes the \"DeltaE9\" mutation of human presenilin 1. The DeltaE9 mutation of the human presenilin 1 gene is a deletion of exon 9 and corresponds to a form of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The amyloid beta precursor protein coding sequences were altered by replacing mouse sequence encoding three amino acids of the A-beta domain with the human coding sequence for these residues. The chimeric amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein sequence was then further modified to encode the Swedish mutations K595N/M596L found in human.  Both the transgenic peptide and holoprotein are detected by Signet Laboratories' monoclonal 6E10 antibody, which is specific for human sequence within this region. Human presenilin protein, which in high levels displaces detectable endogenous mouse protein, is immunodetected in the double transgenic mouse in whole brain protein homogenates. Human amyloid precursor protein is also immunodetected in these mice in whole brain protein homogenates. Transgene insertion occurred on Chr 9, causing a 1 bp duplication.",

This first loxP site is followed by a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the human beta-actin promoter, SV40 polyA, a second FRT site and a second loxP site.  A third loxP site is inserted downstream of the targeted exon(s) at position 78150919.  The critical exon(s) is/are thus flanked by loxP sites.  A \"conditional ready\" (floxed) allele can be created by flp recombinase expression in mice carrying this allele.  Subsequent cre expression results in a knockout mouse.

         "description" : "A murine granzyme A genomic construct (carrying 11-kb putative promoter and 7-kb structural gene with poly-A addition signal) was used for expression of a Ly49A cDNA.  The granzyme A translation start codon was deleted and replaced with a Ly49A cDNA that was inserted into the SmaI site of the modified granzyme A gene. Transgenic mice derived from founder no. 7 expressed Ly49A on nearly all splenic NK1.11 CD32 cells and also expressed Ly49A on approximately one-half of T cells but not on other cell types. <P>Sequence analysis revealed that the Tg construct inserted into exon 5 of the gene for Atf2. Relative to transcription of Atf 2, the Tg construct is directed in the opposite orientation. Analysis of the 3' integration site indicated a fusion of the Tg construct and intron 10. At this end, the Tg construct is oriented in the same direction as Atf 2. PCR of genomic DNA from Tg mice with primers derived from Atf 2 and the transgenic construct confirmed both integration sites into Atf 2. Thus, multiple copies of the Tg construct have inserted into Atf2.  Sequence analysis demonstrated that truncated versions of ATF-2 transcripts encoding only dimerization and DNA binding domains were expressed in Tg NK cells.</P>",

The TI{CRIMIC.TG4.1} cassette was inserted using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique together with a donor plasmid to drive homology directed repair. The sgRNA sequence used to target the gene was: CTTATCTGGTAACTGACCCCAGG. The homology arms of the donor vector overlapped by 4 bp. It is unknown whether the insertion is precise or if there is a small deletion or duplication. The insertion site coordinate is the Cas9 cut site predicted for the CRISPR guide RNA. The PCR check of the insertion gave the expected sized product for the left flank, but no product for the right flank.",
